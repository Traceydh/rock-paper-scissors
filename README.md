# rock-paper-scissors
 The Odin Project foundations course - project rock paper scissors part 1 
 
 The aim of the project was to develop a game of rock paper scissors vs the computer, displaying the results in console. 
 Through this project I've learnt and practiced how to use variables, functions and conditionals statements. 
 
 I hope to come back to this project soon to improve it's interface. 
 
 
 Project Rock Paper Scirrors part 2
This was a great project to consolidate my knowledge on DOM manipulation methods. It was also good practice for CSS styling and problem solving skills. I now have a better understanding on how to develop a functional user interface.
